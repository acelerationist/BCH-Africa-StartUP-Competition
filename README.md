# BCH Africa StartUP Initiative
An initiative aimed at driving mainstream adoption of Bitcoin Cash in Kenya, Africa while supporting startups.

<h2>Project Summary</h2>

<p align="justify">BCH Startup Africa Initiative is a project aimed at creating awareness of Bitcoin Cash in Kenya’s rapidly growing startup ecosystem while providing mentorship, technical and financial support in form of BCH to successful startups.
BCH invested in startups is not free money; it forms a revolving fund that will ensure more startups are supported, sustainability of the initiative, and further channeled back to Bitcoin Cash Fund appropriately. BCH funding will be provided based on a rationale to be developed, and on condition that startups ACCEPT BCH as a medium of exchange for goods and services provided. The first batch of participating startups will lay a foundation for the drive for mainstream adoption of BCH in Kenya as we work on getting existing businesses BCH ready. Videos documenting the journey; selection, mentorship, market testing and pitching will be professionally shot and shared on BCH platform. Participating startups drawn from 22 universities based in the expansive Nairobi County will form on-campus Bitcoin Cash meetups to further Bitcoin Cash agenda.</p>
