# Bitcoin-Cash-Adoption-Kenya
An initiative aimed at driving mainstream adoption of Bitcoin Cash in Kenya, Africa while supporting startups.

#Project Summary
BCH Startup Africa Initiative is a project aimed at creating awareness of Bitcoin Cash in Kenyaâ€™s rapidly growing startup ecosystem while providing mentorship, technical and financial support in form of BCH to successful startups.
BCH invested in startups is not free money; it forms a revolving fund that will ensure more startups are supported, sustainability of the initiative, and further channeled back to Bitcoin Cash Fund appropriately. BCH funding will be provided based on a rationale to be developed, and on condition that startups ACCEPT BCH as a medium of exchange for goods and services provided. The first batch of participating startups will lay a foundation for the drive for mainstream adoption of BCH in Kenya as we work on getting existing businesses BCH ready. Videos documenting the journey; selection, mentorship, market testing and pitching will be professionally shot and shared on BCH platform. Participating startups drawn from 25 universities spread across the country will form on-campus Bitcoin Cash meetups to further Bitcoin Cash agenda.
